# GenApp

this application can be used to generate short or long chord progression using Neo-Riemannian Theory see - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory

in addition to this the generator uses randomly generated section lengths, configurable from the main gui and is able to maintain a balance around section endings and key changes

the final program element is the rhythm generator, ##Important## - this requires the provided font to be installed in order to work correctly, otherwise rhythms will not be displayed correctly
